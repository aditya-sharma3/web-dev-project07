This is a simple project which completed using HTML and CSS only. While doing this project I learned different CSS propertis like `flexbox` and I also learned about how it arrange all the `HTML` elements in `horizon` in case of web version and `vertical` in case of mobile version.
I also learned other propertis like `display` and its types like `block`, `inline-block` and `inline`.
It took me around 3hours to complete this project.
